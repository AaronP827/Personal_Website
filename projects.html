            <h2 class="ProjectName">Database</h2>
            <p>
                The database was built in java that would run PostrgreSQL code to create a database that would allow the 
                user to perform different actions. The user can add employees, editing employees' attributes and pay, remove 
                employees, and log in to different accounts with different privileges. The system has a simple UI with the 
                user being given commands through the console and entering their commands through the console as well.

            <h2 class="ProjectName">MIPS Calculator</h2>
            <p>
                The calculator was created using MIPS, a low level programming language, and allows the user to do standard 
                calculator actions with some extra actions. The actions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
                modular, squaring, factorial, and opposite which allows the user to change from positive to negative or vice 
                versa.

                The tip calculator app was built with Java in Android Studio and allows the user to enter a bill total, tip amount, 
                and number of people to split the bill. The program has a vertical view and a landscape view. The app also saves
                the users preferences.

            <h2 class="ProjectName">Notes System App</h2>
            <p>
                The notes app was built with Java in Android Studio and allows the user to create, edit, and delete notes.
                The app stores the notes in a .json file that is loaded each time the app is opened. The app incorporates 
                multiple "activities" that pass data to and from each other. The data also incorporates dialog boxes that give 
                the user options to interact with the app.

            <h2 class="ProjectName">Weather App</h2>
            <p>
                The weather app was built with Java in Android Studio and allows the user to check the current weather data 
                for a location that they decide. The app gets live data from an API and displays it to the user. There is various 
                data that the app displays such as the current weather, hourly data for up to 48 hours, and the weather for the 
                next couple of days. The app allows the user to swipe down from the top of the screen to refresh the app. The 
                user may also change the units from imperial to metric. The app also uses multiple "activities."
